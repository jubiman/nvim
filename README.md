# Just another LazyVim config

This is my personal Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Features
- Pre-configured with essential plugins for development.
- Custom keybindings for improved productivity.
- Theme and UI enhancements for a better coding experience.

## Installation
1. Install Neovim (version 0.12 or higher).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jubiman/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
3. Open Neovim to install plugins.
4. Restart Neovim to apply all configurations.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the configuration files located in `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/` or `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` to suit your preferences.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [LazyVim documentation](https://www.lazyvim.org/) or open an issue in this repository (I won't promise I'll look at it).
Errors and other logs can be seen using `:NoiceAll`.
